# Array Declaration 2D

> By: Jimmy Pan

- Problem 1: Create a method that takes a 2D array of characters, and prints them out in a grid pattern.
    - Output must match the sample output (spaces between each symbol and a new line for each row)
- Problem 2: What type and what method did I use to create the `symbols2D` array?
    - Ragged/Jagged Array with Shorthand Notation
    - Ragged/Jagged Array with Multi-Step Approach
    - Standard Array with Shorthand Notation
    - Standard Array with Multi-Step Approach

```java
char[][] symbols2D = {
    {'!', '@', '#'},
    {'$', '%', '^'},
    {'&', '*', '(', ')'}
}
```
```
! @ #
$ % ^
& * ( )
```
