# [Create method countingByOne](../)

> By: Jimmy Pan

<hr>

- Create a method that takes 2 integers, print out the numbers from the first number to the second number changing by a count of 1.
    - Don't worry about how the output looks. As long as the numbers are printed in the right order.

```java
countingByOne(10, 5); // 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5
countingByOne(12, 19); // 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
countingByOne(1, 1); // 1
```
