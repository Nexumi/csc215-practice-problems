# [if/else if/else <-> switch/case](../)

> By: Jimmy Pan

<hr>

- Create a method that repeatedly asks the user for an integer, then output the day of the week that number is. 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, etc. End when the user inputs an invalid day of the week.
	- Write 2 methods, one using if/else if/else statements, and another using switch/case statements.

```
Enter a day of the week (0 - 6): 3
3 is Wednesday
Enter a day of the week (0 - 6): 6
6 is Saturday
Enter a day of the week (0 - 6): 15
15 is an invalid day of the week
```
